      IWBI Member Program (defined below) and be eligible to receive benefits of
      membership by fulfilling the requirements described below and accepting

      and collectively, shall be referred to in this Agreement as a “Party” or
      the “Parties”.
    </p>
    <p>
      &emsp;1.&emsp;<strong><u>Description of IWBI Member Program</u></strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      &emsp;The International WELL Building Institute&trade; (IWBI&trade;), in
      collaboration with its community of advocates and users, is leading the
      global movement to transform our buildings and communities in ways that
      help people thrive. IWBI created its Member Program as a means to convene,
      celebrate and collaborate with many of the organizations who are committed
      to these shared values of prioritizing and advancing human health in the
      spaces where we collectively live, work, learn and play.
    </p>
    <p>
      &emsp;IWBI advances its mission through the WELL Building Standard&trade;
      (WELL&trade;), and the WELL Community Standard&trade; pilot and the WELL
      Portfolio&trade; program. WELL is focused exclusively on the ways that
      buildings, communities, and organizations improve our comfort, drive
      better choices and generally enhance, not compromise, our health and
      wellness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &emsp;In addition to its programs designed to be applied at the building,
      community, organization and portfolio scale, IWBI convenes and mobilizes
      the wellness real estate community through management of the WELL
      AP&trade; credential, the pursuit of applicable research, the development
      of educational resources and advocacy for policies that promote health and
      wellness everywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &emsp;Because Organization is committed to advance this global movement,
      IWBI would like to offer Organization the opportunity to participate in
      the benefits outlined on the IWBI Member page on IWBI’s website and
      available
      <a href="https://www.wellcertified.com/membership" target="_blank"
        >here</a
      >
      (the “Member Page”). The IWBI Member Program refers to IWBI’s provision of
      benefits described in the Member page (“Member Benefits”) to organizations
      that confirm fulfillment of one of the Member Requirements.
    </p>
    <p>
      &emsp;Organization is eligible to receive Member Benefits associated with
      the relevant tier of membership during the Term (defined below) upon
      payment of the membership fee applicable to the appropriate tier of
      membership (“Membership Fee”) or enrollment in WELL Portfolio Program (the
      foregoing items are collectively referred to in this Agreement as the
      "Member Requirements").Organization hereby confirms it has fulfilled one
      of the Member Requirements.
    </p>
    <p>
      &emsp;Upon IWBI’s confirmation that Organization has completed and
      fulfilled one of the Member Requirements described above and provided
      Organization remains in compliance with this Agreement, Organization will
      have the opportunity to participate in the Member Benefits. All Member
      Benefits are subject to modification and change by IWBI at any time as
      IWBI further develops, updates and improves its programs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &emsp;2.&emsp;<strong><u>Publicity; Use of Name.</u></strong> Either Party
      may, without the prior written consent of the other Party, disclose or
      publicize in its promotional, marketing and advertising materials,
      including without limitation, on its websites, during the Term that
      Organization is an IWBI Member and the appropriate tier of membership, as
      applicable. IWBI will permit Organization to use a trademark provided by
      IWBI and reserved for IWBI Members (“Member Mark”) that Organization may
      use solely during the Term to represent the Organization’s membership
      status and, as applicable, tier of membership in Organization’s
      proprietary marketing materials, print advertisements, tradeshow or event
      materials, and social media posts. Organization agrees that all uses of
      the IWBI Member Mark or references to its status as an IWBI Member at the
      Portfolio, Keystone or Cornerstone level, and any other permitted and
      authorized use of IWBI names, and trademarks and logos shall remain in
      compliance with the

        >Marketing Resources page</a
      >) and other IWBI marketing guidance that IWBI may provide to
      Organization. For the avoidance of doubt, this Agreement and/or the
      licenses granted herein shall in no way be construed as an understanding
      that IWBI will recommend or endorse an Organization’s products or services
      to any third party. Other than any consent explicitly provided in this
      Agreement, Organization hereby agrees and acknowledges that it shall not
      use any logo, name, trade name, service mark or trademark of IWBI and/or
      its affiliates (“IWBI Marks”), without IWBI’s prior, written consent, and,
      by way of example and not of limitation, Organization shall not use the
      IWBI Member Mark or any name, trademark or logo of IWBI in connection with
      a building, location or product or displayed in any other media without
      IWBI’s prior written consent. All requests for approval should be sent by
      email to
      <a href="mailto:marketing@wellcertified.com"
        >marketing@wellcertified.com</a
      >
      at least five (5) business days prior to the date a response is needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &emsp;Organization acknowledges that it owns certain names, trademarks,
      service marks, copyrights and other intellectual location (“Organization
      Marks”), and owns or has certain merchandising rights in and to
      Organization Marks and all goodwill associated with or symbolized by them.
      It is understood that in promoting the activities of IWBI on its website,
      in press releases and in other marketing materials, IWBI may make
      reference to Organization, and in so doing, may display and use
      Organization’s name and Organization Marks. Organization hereby grants to
      IWBI a nonexclusive, nontransferable, worldwide, royalty-free, paid up
      license to use Organization Marks and other images or materials
      Organization provides to IWBI in connection with receiving the Member
      Benefits during the Term of this Agreement, solely in connection with
      advertising and promoting the activities of IWBI and its products and
      offerings, including but not limited to including Organization Marks on
      the portion of IWBI’s website describing or promoting the IWBI Member
      Program and in other promotional materials such as slide decks, event
      signage, social media posts and print collateral referencing or related to
      the IWBI Member Program. Organization shall provide digital images of
      Organization Marks to IWBI by, for instance, uploading its Organization
      Marks to IWBI’s Member portal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &emsp;Neither Party will impugn, challenge or assist in any challenge to
      the validity of the other Party’s Marks, any registrations thereof, or the
      ownership thereof. Each Party will be solely responsible for taking such
      actions as it deems appropriate to obtain trademark, service mark or
      copyright registration for its respective Marks. All uses of or references
      to the Marks shall inure to the benefit of the respective owner, and all
      rights with respect to the Marks not specifically granted in this
      Agreement shall be and are hereby reserved to the respective owner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &emsp;3.&emsp;<strong><u>Confidentiality.</u></strong> During the Term,
      IWBI may provide Organization with written, oral or virtually presented
      nonpublic information related to IWBI and/or its products and offerings,
      including but not limited to draft documentation, financial information,
      databases and materials, preliminary product and offerings in development,
      draft versions of or nonpublic materials relating to the WELL Building
      Standard, WELL v2 pilot, WELL Community Standard or pilots thereof, the
      WELL Portfolio program, other draft or proposed pathways or programming
      materials related thereto, and other nonpublic proprietary information
      (collectively, “Confidential Information”). Confidential Information does
      not include any information or material that Organization evidences is:
      (a) already known to Organization at the time of disclosure (other than
      from IWBI); (b) publicly known other than through acts or omissions of
      Organization; (c) disclosed to Organization by a third party who has not
      and is not under any obligation of confidentiality; or (d) independently
      developed by employees of Organization, other than in connection with its
      performance of this Agreement, without knowledge of or access to the
      Confidential Information. As between the Parties, IWBI exclusively owns
      the Confidential Information, including any suggestions, recommendations
      or feedback relating thereto. Except as otherwise required by law, the
      specific term and conditions of this Agreement shall be Confidential
      Information but neither the existence of this Agreement nor Organization’s
      membership status shall be Confidential Information. Except as expressly
      permitted herein, Organization shall not disclose, use or otherwise make
      available Confidential Information during the Term and for three (3) years
      thereafter and will use the same degree of care it employs to protect is
      own confidential information. If Member is required by law, regular or
      court order to disclose any of the Confidential Information, it will have
      the right to do so, provided it (i) promptly notifies IWBI; and (ii)
      reasonably assists IWBI to obtain a protective order or other remedy of
      IWBI's election and only disclose the information that is legally required
      to be disclosed to satisfy such obligation. Each Party acknowledges that
      any breach of Sections 2 or 3 of this Agreement would cause irreparable
      harm to the other Party, the amount of which may be difficult to
      ascertain, and Organization agrees that injunctive and other equitable
      relief is therefore appropriate in the event of a breach by the other
      Party of any of the terms of Sections 2 or 3. Such remedy shall not be
      exclusive of any other remedies available to a Party, nor shall it be
      deemed an election of remedies by a Party.
    </p>
    <p>
      &emsp;4.&emsp;<strong><u>Compliance with Laws.</u></strong> Each Party
      agrees that, in performing its duties hereunder, it shall not directly or
      indirectly, promise, offer or give anything of value to any “Covered
      Person” (as defined below) for the purpose of influencing any act or
      decision of such Covered Person, including a decision to do or omit to do
      any act in violation of the duties of such Covered Person, or inducing
      such Covered Person to use his or her influence with any other person or
      entity of any kind whatsoever to improperly affect or influence any act or
      decision of such person or entity, in order to assist IWBI or Organization
      to obtain or retain business, direct business to any person or obtain any
      improper advantage. For purposes hereof, the term “Covered Person” shall
      mean any of the following: (i) an officer, employee, agent or
      representative of any government (including any department, agency,
      instrumentality or subdivision thereof); (ii) an officer, employee, agent
      or representative of any public international organization; (iii) an
      officer, director, employee, agent or representative of an entity owned or
      controlled, in whole or in part, by any government (including any
      department, agency, instrumentality or subdivision thereof); (iv) a person
      acting in an official capacity on behalf of any of the persons or entities
      listed in (i) through (iii) above; (v) a political party, an official of a
      political party or a candidate for political office; and (vi) any first,
      second or third degree family relative of any of the persons listed in (i)
      through (v) above.
    </p>
    <p>
      &emsp;5.&emsp;<strong><u>Term.</u></strong> The term of this Agreement
      will begin upon Organization’s acceptance of this Agreement and (i)
      Organization’s payment and IWBI’s receipt of the Membership Fee
      (“Effective Date”), and will continue to remain in effect for one of the
      following periods of time unless earlier terminated pursuant to Section
      5.1 or 5.2 below: (i) one year if Organization has paid for one year of
      Membership Fees; or or has otherwise fulfilled the Membership
      Requirements; (ii) two, three, four or five years, at Organization’s
      option, if Organization has paid for the respective amount of years of
      membership (options (i) and (ii) are each referred to as the applicable
      “Term”). The Parties may agree to successive one-year or, if applicable,
      multi-year terms upon Organization’s acceptance of the latest version of
      the IWBI Member Agreement and payment of the current year’s applicable
      Membership Fee (or Membership Fee for additional years if Organization
      chooses to pay for multiple years of membership).
    </p>
    <p>&emsp;The Membership Agreement may be terminated as follows:</p>
    <div class="mg-l-30">
      <div class="mg-b-10">
        5.1&emsp;Either Party may terminate this Agreement for any reason upon
        thirty (30) days’ prior written notice to the other Party.
      </div>
      <div class="mg-b-10">
        5.2&emsp;IWBI may terminate this Agreement at any time upon ten (10)
        days’ prior written notice upon failure of Organization to submit the
        applicable Membership Fee or otherwise fulfill the Membership
        Requirements.
      </div>
      <div class="mg-b-10">
        5.3 &emsp;Either Party may terminate this Agreement immediately upon
        written notice to the other Party, without liability to any other party,
        upon the happening of any of the following or any other comparable
        event: (i) material breach of the terms of this Agreement, including,
        without limitation, breach of intellectual location rights or any
        provisions in Sections 2 or 3 above; (ii) insolvency of either Party;
        (iii) filing of any petition by or against any other Party under any
        bankruptcy, reorganization or receivership law; (iv) execution of an
        assignment for the benefit of any other Party’s creditors; or (v)
        appointment of any trustee or receiver of any other Party’s business or
        assets or any part thereof; unless such petition, assignment or
        appointment is withdrawn or nullified within fifteen (15) days of such
        event. The foregoing remedies are in addition to, and not in lieu of,
        any other rights or remedies that a party may have at law or in equity
        or under this Agreement.
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      &emsp;6.&emsp;<strong><u>Effect of Termination.</u></strong> In the event
      of expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement other than by
      mutual consent, neither Party shall be relieved of any of its liabilities
      or obligations arising hereunder unless explicitly stated otherwise
      herein. Upon the effective date of termination, Organization shall no
      longer have access to or the opportunity to receive any Member Benefits.
      Any licenses granted herein shall cease immediately and each Party shall
      cease using the other Party’s trademarks, service marks and logos. Upon
      the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement, each Party shall
      discontinue use of the other Party’s Marks as soon as reasonably
      practicable. Any Confidential Information in Organization’s possession
      shall be returned or destroyed at IWBI’s option and request, and
      Organization shall confirm in writing that such destruction has occurred.
      Articles 3, 8, 9 and 10 shall survive termination of this Agreement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &emsp;7.&emsp;<strong><u>Membership Fee.</u></strong> Organization shall
      pay an annual amount applicable to the Cornerstone or Keystone tier of
      membership as set forth on the Member Page. Organization may opt to pay
      for additional years of membership for up to five (5) years, in which case
      IWBI will generate an invoice to reflect the Membership Fee associated
      with the time period selected by Organization and the Membership Fee will
      equal the amount provided in such invoice. The Parties understand and
      agree that the Membership Fee, or any portion thereof, is not returnable
      or reimbursable to Organization for any reason, including but not limited
      to early termination of this Agreement for any reason. The first
      Membership Fee is due upon acceptance of this Membership Agreement. All
      subsequent Membership Fees for any renewal terms are due on the annual
      anniversary of the Effective Date, unless Organization has opted for a
      longer term of membership, in which case, at the expiration of such longer
      Term, Organization may opt to pay the then-current Membership Fee to
      continue receiving Member Benefits. Payments shall be made by credit card
      or by wire transfer to an account designed by IWBI on the invoice. IWBI
      reserves the right to increase the amount of the Membership Fee each year;
      provided, however, that any fee increase will not be effective until
      Organization’s renewal of the IWBI Member Program. For the avoidance of
      doubt, in the event Organization decides to pay for multiple years of
      membership in advance, Organization will not be subject to any increases
      in the Membership Fee during such multi-year Term, and Organization
      entering the IWBI Member Program at the Cornerstone level will be
      permitted to move to the Keystone level of membership at any time during
      such multi-year Term at the same Membership Fee that was in effect and
      applicable to the Keystone tier of membership on the Effective Date. All
      fees are represented in United States Dollars. The total fees due under
      this Agreement are exclusive of any foreign taxes. Foreign taxes, if any,
      will be the responsibility of the Organization.

      Except as explicitly stated herein, IWBI makes no and hereby disclaims, to
      the greatest extent allowed by law, any and all warranties,
      representations and conditions, whether written, oral, express, implied or
      statutory, including any warranties of accuracy, completeness, title,

      Portfolio program, WELL AP program and education offerings or any other
      IWBI program or service referenced herein.
    </p>
    <p>
      &emsp;The IWBI Program is separate and apart from the WELL Certification
      program and membership status or the fact that Organization is receiving
      benefits associated with IWBI membership has no bearing on a project’s
      pursuit of WELL Certification or the likelihood of a project or portfolio
      achieving WELL Certification or a WELL Portfolio Score. Organization
      acknowledges and agrees that any statement made by an IWBI representative
      offered in discussions between the Parties does not constitute advice, a
      promise or a warranty that may be relied upon relating to whether or not a
      point, feature, part, credit, precondition or other similar matter will be
      granted to a project of Organization in the course of its pursuit of WELL
      Certification or a WELL Portfolio Score, and nothing herein nor any
      statements made in discussions between the Parties shall be construed as
      any representation or warranty regarding the likelihood of Organization
      achieving WELL Certification or a WELL Portfolio Score for any of its
      projects or portfolios, respectively.

      &emsp;IWBI’s activities, the WELL Building Standard and WELL Community
      Standard, the WELL Portfolio program and all versions thereof, are not
      intended in any way to guarantee, certify, warrant or imply that
      Organization’s project or portfolio (or any individual building(s) or
      space(s) comprising Organization’s project) is structurally sound or safe,
      constructed in accordance with applicable laws, regulations or codes, free
      of mold or mildew, or free of bacteria, viruses, pathogens, volatile
      organic compounds, allergens, or toxins. Further, IWBI’s activities, the
      WELL Building Standard and WELL Community Standard and WELL Portfolio
      program (and versions thereof and other programs and pathways related
      thereto) are intended to educate and assist project owners in their effort
      to create healthier indoor spaces and communities, and nothing in this
      Agreement or related to the IWBI Membership or content made available by
      IWBI should be considered, or used as a substitute for medical advice,
      diagnosis or treatment. IWBI’s activities, the WELL Building Standard and
      WELL Community Standard and WELL Portfolio program (and versions thereof
      and other programs and pathways related thereto) do not constitute the
      practice of medicine or the provision of any professional healthcare
      service, diagnosis or treatment. IWBI’s activities, the WELL Building
      Standard and WELL Community Standard and WELL Portfolio program (and
      versions thereof and other programs and pathways related thereto) do not
      in any way guarantee, certify, warrant or imply that such project will
      make occupants healthy or healthier, or provide any benefit to occupants
      whatsoever. IWBI does not make any representation or warranty whatsoever
      with respect to the validity or strength of any of the IWBI Marks, or any
      other intellectual location that IWBI owns or uses. IWBI does not make any
      representation or warranty that it will continue the IWBI Membership
      program (or any benefits offered in connection therewith) for any
      particular length of time and may discontinue any such program or subset
      thereof at any time.

    <p>
      &emsp;Except as otherwise required by law, in no event shall IWBI or any
      of its affiliates be liable to you or any third party, with respect to any
      and all claims, rights, or otherwise, for any special, indirect,
      incidental, punitive, or consequential damages, including damages or costs
      due to loss of profits, tax credits, economic benefits, data, loss of
      goodwill, or personal or other location damage regarding this Agreement or
      resulting from or in connection with the performance of this Agreement,
      and in no event shall IWBI’s or its affiliates’ liability to Organization
      exceed the Membership Fee paid by Organization and collected by IWBI in
      the previous twelve months under this Agreement, in each case regardless
      of the cause of action or the theory of liability, whether in tort,
      contract, or otherwise, even if such Party has been notified of the
