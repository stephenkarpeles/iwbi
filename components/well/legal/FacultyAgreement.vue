      <li>
        <strong>&nbsp;APPLICATION PROCESS.</strong> By accepting this Agreement
        you hereby submit your application for consideration to be a recognized

      <li>
        <strong>&nbsp;SELECTION PROCESS.</strong> IWBI will initiate its review
        to determine if you are eligible for participation in the Program upon
        receipt of your application. During its evaluation, IWBI may request
        additional documentation, resubmission of files and/or documentation,
        and any other information IWBI deems relevant. IWBI will select
        candidates in its sole and absolute discretion. IWBI makes no
        representation regarding the duration of the selection process. IWBI
        will notify you of its decision with regard to your eligibility by email
        sent to the address in your application. You represent and warrant that
        you have the authority and sufficient rights to provide those

        have maintained your status and license from IWBI, including all
        required payments, as a “WELL Faculty™” (such mark as defined below in
        Section 3, License).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>&nbsp;LICENSE.</strong> Upon notification by IWBI of your
        selection as participant in the Program, IWBI thereafter grants you a
        non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty free, revocable and worldwide
        right and license to display the “WELL Faculty <sup>TM</sup>” word mark
        (the “ <u>Mark</u>”) for the purposes of identifying yourself as an
        admitted participant in the Program for the Term hereof. You agree that
        all goods and services provided under the Mark will be of good quality
        and IWBI will have the right to inspect and approve materials bearing
        the Mark. Accordingly, you will provide samples of your use of the Mark
        to IWBI upon request. You will not use the Mark or any other IWBI
        trademark to indicate or suggest IWBI’s endorsement or promotion of your
        programs, products, or services other than in conjunction with certain
        CE approved courses where IWBI has expressly granted you such
        permission; provided however, that you may generally identify yourself
        as WELL Faculty in your educational undertakings as related to the
        Program for the term hereof. You will use the Mark in compliance with
        all federal, state and local laws and regulations. Further, you will
        comply at all times with the IWBI Branding Guidelines (the "Branding
        Guidelines") as published by IWBI online at
        <a

        >, and as may be updated from time to time by IWBI, and any other
        reasonable related standards associated with the use of the Marks as
        provided by IWBI in writing to you. All rights not expressly granted
        herein are reserved by IWBI, and no license is granted hereunder for the
        use of the Mark for any purpose beyond the uses set forth in this
        Agreement, or to any other intellectual location of IWBI.
        <p>
          In addition, IWBI requires you, as WELL Faculty, to notify IWBI of
          opportunities you create or discover to create courses and other
          educational materials related to the Program or the WELL Building
          Standard in any physical, electronic or other media, and via any
          platform or other distribution system or process, with third party
          creators, and IWBI reserves the right to review content created or
          used by you or such third party creators and to license its marks to
          such third party creators as appropriate; however, any live
          performance and distribution of content, whether online or through any
          other media or platform, shall still be considered to be an “event”
          pursuant to Section 7, and, if any courses or content are recorded for
          potential reuse, regardless of whether or not such content was live,
          such recording shall be sent to IWBI be reviewed before any further
          use or distribution of such recording is made.
        </p>
        <p>
          You agree and acknowledge that all rights, good will and other
          benefits accruing to you as a result of your use of the Mark, and/or
          participation in the Program, will inure to the benefit of IWBI. You
          agree to assist and cooperate with IWBI in the perfection and/or
          enforcement of those rights, good will and other benefits.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>&nbsp;PROGRAM BENEFITS.</strong> In addition to the foregoing

        and access to certain IWBI instructional resources (i.e., Powerpoint
        presentations, learning activities, lesson plans, workbooks, videos,
        case studies and podcasts) selected by IWBI to support teaching of WELL
        Building Standard concepts (which instructional resources you must not
        modify in any manner without IWBI’s prior written consent), and such
        other benefits which IWBI may from time to time, in its sole discretion,
        make available to you. For the avoidance of doubt, you are not permitted
        to modify any content provided by IWBI, but you may author, be
        responsible for and include additional slides to IWBI’s power point
        presentations to tailor such presentations to meet the needs of your
        audience; provided such additional slides are consistent with quality of
        instructional content provided to you herein. Additional terms and
        conditions may apply to your use and enjoyment of the foregoing
        benefits. Your access to, and permissions to use, all such benefits will
        automatically terminate upon the effective date of termination of this
        Agreement.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>&nbsp;MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS.</strong> Upon being approved and
        so licensed under the Program, you agree that you will, on an ongoing
        basis and at all times during the term hereof, maintain the basis of
        your eligibility under the Program per the WELL Faculty Maintenance
        Requirements contained in Exhibit A. You will promptly provide proof of
        your compliance with the applicable requirements upon request.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>&nbsp;TERM.</strong>This Agreement will begin upon your payment
        of the annual Program Fee as set forth below in Section 7 (provided,
        however, that you may pay such fee only after IWBI has notified you, in
        writing, of its affirmative decision regarding your eligibility as set
        forth above in Section 2) (the “ <u>Effective Date</u>”) and will
        continue in effect until December 31 of the same calendar year (the “
        <u>Initial Term</u>”). Thereafter, subject to your confirmation of your
        acceptance of and continued compliance with this Agreement or any
        updated version of this Agreement that IWBI may provide to you, this
        Agreement will renew for successive one (1) year periods (each a
        “Renewal Term” and together with the Initial Term, the “ <u>Term</u>”)
        unless or until either party terminates as provided herein or provides
        the other party notice of its intent not to renew at any time prior to
        the expiration of the Initial Term or then-current Renewal Term as
        applicable. IWBI will provide you with reasonable notice of renewal, and
        then-applicable Program Fee (defined below).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>&nbsp;FEES.</strong>As consideration for your participation in
        the Program, you must pay a WELL Faculty Program Fee (the “
        <u>Program Fee</u>”). The first annual Program Fee is identified in your
        application for participation in the Program and the Program Fee for
        each year thereafter shall be identified in the renewal notice provided
        to you by IWBI. The first annual Program Fee is due within thirty (30)
        days of IWBI’s written notification to you of your acceptance as a
        participant in the Program. All Program Fees thereafter shall be due by
        the date specified in the applicable renewal notice. IWBI reserves the
        right to increase the Program Fee by not more than twenty percent (20%)
        per annual period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent you
        receive written notification by IWBI of its affirmative decision
        regarding your selection as a participant in the Program (i) on or after
        July 1, you will receive a fifty percent (50%) discount on the Program
        Fee applicable to the Initial Term of this Agreement, or (ii) on or
        after November 1, your fee will be waived for the Initial Term. Further,
        if you apply for the Program on or before December 31, 2020 and you
        submit evidence of your status as an employee of an IWBI Member at the
        Keystone or Cornerstone level, then you are eligible for a thirty
        percent (30%) or fifteen percent (15%) discount, respectively, depending
        on the level of membership of your employer. In addition, current WELL
        concept advisors who apply for the Program on or before December 31,
        2020 are eligible for a waiver of the Program Fee for so long as and to
        the extent that their WELL concept advisor status remains in good
        standing. Your fee shall calculated as set forth below in either Section
        7.1, Section 7.2 or Section 7.3, depending on format and hosting of
        event.

        <ol class="space-y-4">
          <li>
            <u>Education Event Hosted by IWBI.</u> In the event IWBI hosts an
            exam preparation or educational workshop and selects you to present
            instructional materials at such IWBI hosted event, IWBI will pay you
            a fee and reimburse you for reasonable, documented out-of-pocket
            expenses in accordance with a separate written document
            substantially similar to Exhibit B. IWBI will be responsible for
            logistics of events, including but not limited to securing venue,
            marketing and supplies and paying for other expenses associated with
            the course or workshop. As the contracted WELL Faculty members, you
            will be responsible for content and instruction. IWBI will be
            responsible for registration of exam preparation or educational
            workshop, which will occur via IWBI’s education portal.
          </li>
          <li>
            <u>Education Event Hosted by IWBI Collaborator.</u> In the event you
            lead an exam preparation course or workshop at the request of one of
            IWBI’s collaborators pursuant to a separate agreement between you
            and such collaborator, then your fee will be stated in such
            agreement with the collaborator. IWBI collaborator will be
            responsible for logistics of events, including but not limited to,
            submitting education events to IWBI to be listed on IWBI’s website
            and paying applicable Event Listing Fee (as defined hereafter),
            securing venue, marketing and supplies and paying for other expenses
            associated with the course or workshop. As the contracted WELL
            Faculty members, you will be responsible for content and
            instruction.
          </li>
          <li>
            <u>Education Event Hosted by You.</u> In the event, you host a
            course independently, either in-person or online, you shall
            coordinate and be responsible for all logistics associated with such
            event, including but not limited to securing venue, catering,
            technology set-up, among others). In this instance that You host an
            event pursuant to this Section 7.3, you shall retain the full amount
            of revenue generated from the applicable event, subject to
            applicable fees owed to IWBI pursuant to Section 7.4 below,
            including any applicable speaker fee you obtain.
          </li>
          <li>
            <u>Event Listing Fees and Information Submission.</u> In the event
            You host an event under Section 7.3, You shall submit the following
            to IWBI, as applicable:
            <br />
            <br />&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Prior to each WELL education event
            hosted under this Agreement, You shall notify IWBI of each such WELL
            education event hosted hereunder, list each such WELL education
            event on IWBI’s website, submit applicable event listing fee as
            described below in this paragraph, and provide IWBI with the
            expected number of participants, if the event can be publicly
            advertised to the WELL AP community at large (in which case it shall
            be deemed public, and if not it shall be deemed private), and
            applicable fee for each participant. Following each WELL education
            event hosted hereunder, You shall collect and share with IWBI
            information about participants required for Continuing Education
            reporting (including but not limited to name, email address, WELL AP
            number, date and duration of event) and/or information required for
            the generation of Certificates of Completion (including but not
            limited to name, email address and date). You shall obtain all
            necessary licenses, consents and permissions to fulfill the
            foregoing in accordance with local laws and regulations, and, for
            the avoidance of doubt You shall be responsible for ensuring all
            education workshop participants are notified that their contact

            education credits and for purposes of IWBI contacting them directly
            in the future to inform them of IWBI updates, services, offerings
            and events. You shall submit any and all WELL education events, to
            IWBI, regardless of whether public or private, for IWBI’s awareness,
            but only public events shall be listed on IWBI’s website at
            <a href="https://www.wellcertified.com/en/iwbispeaker-event-request"
              >https://www.wellcertified.com/en/iwbispeaker-event-request</a
            >. Further, public events are subject to a fee equal to one hundred
            ten United States dollars (USD $110.00) for publicizing each such
            public event (“Event Listing Fee”); provided, however, that the
            first five public events shall be covered by your annual WELL
            Faculty fee and will not require such additional Event Listing Fee.
            Further, no Event Listing Fee will be required of private events, or
            from public events only if expected revenue from said public event
            is less than five hundred US dollars ($500.00).
            <br />
            <br />&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Publication of your event listing on
            IWBI’s website will take five (5) business days, so events must be
            reported via the speaker request form at least six (6) business days
            prior to the event date; events submitted five (5) or less business
            days prior to the date of the event will not be eligible for the
            reporting of Continuing Education or distribution of Certificates of
            Completion. If events are not properly submitted within this time
            frame, events must still be submitted to IWBI and shall still incur
            the Event Listing Fee, if applicable.

      <li>

        in the Program, you agree to: i) be diligent, honest and ethical in your
        dealings associated with the Program; ii) render your products and
        services in a professional and competent manner; and iii) perform your
        duties in accordance with all relevant laws, regulations, and pertinent
        IWBI policies. Further, you acknowledge that IWBI has established
        prestige and goodwill in the Program and the Marks, which are well
        recognized in the minds of the public throughout the world. It is of
        great importance, and in the mutual interest of you, IWBI, and all other
        participants in the Program that your conduct, products, and services
        embody the highest standards and reputation connected with IWBI.
        Therefore, you agree that if you use the Marks in any manner that, in
        IWBI’s sole discretion, disparages, tarnishes, or dilutes the
        distinctive quality of the Marks or the reputation and goodwill embodied
        in the Marks, or which reflects adversely on the Marks, IWBI and/or the
        Program, then at the time of any such act or at any time after IWBI
        learns of any such act, IWBI will have the right, at its sole option, to
        terminate this Agreement, effective immediately upon the provision by
        IWBI of written notice to you.

        <strong>&nbsp;TERMINATION.</strong> IWBI or you may terminate this
        Agreement at any time by written notice to you or IWBI, as applicable,
        provided however, that your termination of this Agreement will not
        release you from your obligations to pay any fees incurred prior to the
        effective date of such termination. IWBI may terminate this Agreement
        effective immediately upon providing notice to you of your breach of
        your obligations under this Agreement. Upon termination of this
        Agreement, all of your rights to use the Marks pursuant to the license
        granted in this Agreement will immediately terminate and you will
        thereafter immediately discontinue all use and display of the Marks.
        Further you will promptly return any materials and intellectual location
        of IWBI as provided under the Program, and destroy any other materials
        which remain in your possession or reasonable control containing the
        Marks, and confirm in writing to IWBI promptly after such destruction
        has occurred. You agree to retain no such location in any form.

        PROVIDED HEREIN, IWBI MAY CHANGE ANY OF THE PROGRAM POLICIES, WELL
        FACULTY AGREEMENT, BENEFITS OR GUIDELINES AT ANY TIME IN ITS SOLE
        DISCRETION. IWBI WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH WRITTEN NOTICE OF ANY MATERIAL
        CHANGE TO THE PROGRAM THAT COULD REASONABLY BE DETERMINED TO NEGATIVELY
        IMPACT YOU AS A PARTICIPANT. THEREAFTER, YOUR ONGOING USE OF THE MARKS
        CONSTITUTES YOUR IRREVOCABLE ACCEPTANCE OF ALL THESE CHANGES THAT WERE
        MADE, AND THE LEGAL AMENDMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT. IN THE EVENT OF ANY
        MODIFICATION OF ANY MATERIAL TERMS IN ACCORDANCE HEREWITH TO WHICH YOU
        DO NOT ASSENT, YOUR SOLE REMEDY WILL BE THE RIGHT TO TERMINATE THE
        AGREEMENT AND DISCONTINUE YOUR PARTICIPATION IN THE PROGRAM.

        <strong>&nbsp;LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.</strong> EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE
        REQUIRED BY LAW, AND EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE AND/OR
        INTENTIONAL MISCONDUCT OF IWBI, IN NO EVENT WILL IWBI BE LIABLE TO YOU
        OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
        PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING DAMAGES OR COSTS DUE TO
        LOSS OF PROFITS, TAX CREDITS, ECONOMIC BENEFITS, DATA, LOSS OF GOODWILL,
        PERSONAL INJURY, OR PERSONAL OR OTHER LOCATION DAMAGE ARISING OUT OF

        are required to indemnify any of the IWBI Indemnities, you will not
        enter into any settlement without obtaining IWBI’s prior written
        consent, which will not be unreasonably withheld. Without limitation of
        the foregoing, any or all of the IWBI Indemnitees may elect to
        participate in any cause of action with counsel of their choosing at
        their own expense.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>&nbsp;EQUITABLE REMEDIES.</strong> The Marks and the goodwill
        associated therewith possess special, unique, and extraordinary
        characteristics, which make difficult the assessment of monetary damages
        that IWBI would sustain as a result of your unauthorized use thereof.
        You recognize that IWBI would suffer irreparable injury by such
        unauthorized use and agree that injunctive and other equitable relief is
        appropriate in the event of such unauthorized use. Such remedy will not
        be exclusive of any other remedies available to IWBI, nor will it be
        deemed an election of remedies by IWBI.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>&nbsp;GOVERNING LAW.</strong> This Agreement and all of the
        rights and duties of you and IWBI arising out of or related to the
        Program and/or the relationship between you and IWBI are governed by the
        laws of the State of New York. Any dispute, claim or controversy between
        or among the parties hereto arising out of or in any way related to this
        Agreement shall be submitted for resolution before, and each party
        expressly consents to the jurisdiction and venue of, the state and/or
        federal courts located in the City, County and State of New York, and
        each of the parties expressly and irrevocably consent to the
        jurisdiction of such courts.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>&nbsp;RELATIONSHIP OF THE PARTIES.</strong> The relationship
        between the parties to this Agreement is that of independent
        contractors. This Agreement is not intended to, and does not, create any
        association, partnership, joint venture, employment, or agency
        relationship between the parties. You will not hold yourself out as an
        agent, affiliate, legal representative, joint-venturer, partner,
        employee or servant of any of the IWBI Indemnitees for any purpose
        whatsoever.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>&nbsp;THIRD PARTIES AND ASSIGNMENT OF RIGHTS.</strong> Nothing
        in this Agreement will be deemed to confer any benefit or rights on or
        to any person or entity other than you and IWBI; provided however, that
        those IWBI Indemnitees other than IWBI are intended third-party
        beneficiaries to this Agreement with independent rights of enforcement.
        IWBI reserves the right to assign and/or delegate any of its rights
        and/or obligations in its sole discretion, including, and without
        limitation, the right to subcontract the performance of any services
        associated with the Program. On the other hand, you understand your role
        in the Program is extraordinary and unique, and that, accordingly, you
        may not delegate or assign any license, opportunity, benefit, or
        obligation granted to you under this Agreement. Any unauthorized
        assignment or delegation will be null and void, will be a material
        breach of this Agreement, and will be cause for immediate termination of
        this Agreement.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>&nbsp;PRIOR AGREEMENTS.</strong> You agree that this Agreement
        supersedes any understanding and/or terminates any prior agreement(s)
        previously entered into between you and IWBI, if any, regarding the
        subject matter hereto as of the Effective Date hereof. The parties
        hereto acknowledge that the terms and conditions of this Agreement are
        mutually beneficial over and above that of any prior agreement(s) and
        therefore serve as sufficient consideration supporting the legal
        validity of this Agreement.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>&nbsp;INTERPRETATION.</strong> The invalidity of any part of
        this Agreement shall not impair or affect the validity or enforceability
        of the rest of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and
        effect. Any provision found to be invalid will be more narrowly
        construed so that it becomes legal and enforceable. The headings used in
        this document are for ease of reference only and shall not in any way be
        construed to limit or alter the meaning of any provision. Any rule that
        ambiguities are construed or interpreted against the drafter of a
        document, or against the party for whose benefit the document is made,
        will not apply.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>&nbsp;INCORPORATION.</strong> This Agreement, including Exhibit
        A and the Branding Guidelines, each of which are hereby incorporated in
        this Agreement by this reference and made a part hereof in their
        entirety, constitutes a fully integrated agreement that supersedes any
        and all prior agreements between you and IWBI concerning the Program.
        The terms and conditions for the use of any IWBI website(s) hosting the
        Program do not supersede this Agreement.
