        Congratulations on your commitment to advancing health through smarter
        buildings. The WELL Performance Rating is a roadmap for organizations to
        establish best practices for continuously monitoring and measuring
        building performance across key indoor environmental quality (IEQ)
        indicators related to air quality, water quality, thermal comfort,
        acoustics, lighting and occupant experience. By integrating the rating
        into your existing offerings, you can help your clients compare their
        buildingâ€™s performance to global benchmarks for health and well-being
        and shift the way they do business for the better.
      </p>
