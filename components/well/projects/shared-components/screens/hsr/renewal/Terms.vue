                    <strong>OVERVIEW.</strong> The WELL Health-Safety Rating™
                    for Facility Operations and Management (the “WELL
                    Health-Safety Rating”) is an evidence-based, third-party
                    verified rating focused on operational policies, maintenance
                    protocols and emergency plans. The WELL Health-Safety Rating
                    is managed and operated by IWBI from the United States,
                    pursuant to applicable U.S. laws and the terms and
                    conditions of this Agreement, regardless of Your geographic
                    location or the geographic location of Your Project. The
                    WELL Health-Safety Rating consists of the process whereby an
                    owner and/or operator applies for the WELL Health-Safety
                    Rating designation (the “Rating Designation”) for one or
                    more of its buildings, facilities, spaces or other real
                    location (collectively, Your “Project”). Applications are
                    reviewed by third party document reviewers in order to
                    maintain the rigor of a third party verified rating. Further
                    information and instructions related to the WELL
                    Health-Safety Rating are set forth in the WELL Health-Safety

                        documentation You submit therewith, and administration
                        of Your Project to determine if it is eligible for the
                        WELL Health-Safety Rating. During such review, You may
                        be asked to provide additional documentation and
                        information deemed relevant. IWBI and the WELL

                        (each, a “Review Timeline”). Many factors including
                        complexity and volume of submissions may impact the
                        Review Timeline and while the failure to meet any Review

                        reviews may be subject to an additional fee. The Rating
                        Designation is valid for one year from the date in which
                        it is achieved, and it is subject to renewal, including

                        pursued (collectively, “Project Information”) to IWBI
                        and the WELL Reviewer in order to complete third party
                        verification and review of Your Application. You hereby
                        grant IWBI, and its affiliates, agents, representatives
                        and contractors (including the WELL Reviewer), a
                        non-exclusive, royalty- free and fully paid-up license
                        to access, view, reproduce and otherwise use Project
                        Information that You submit for the purposes of

                        7.2. “Public” Projects. Unless You affirmatively select
                        the option for Your Project to be “private” (see Section
                        7.3 below), Your Project is, by default, considered a
                        “public” project (a “Public Project”) and, as such, is
                        included in a public directory of projects (the “WELL
                        Project Directory”). Inclusion in the WELL Project
                        Directory allows the general public and members of the
                        media to look up specific project listings and the
                        following details: Project name, Project location,
                        Project type, Enrollment Date, Project owner, owner
                        organization type or sector, Project size and the date
                        the Rating Designation was awarded (collectively,
                        “Public Project Information”). IWBI shall not distribute
                        or publish any submitted policies, protocols or plans
                        pertaining to Your Project (“Confidential Project
                        Information”) without Your written permission except to
                        IWBI’s employees, agents, representatives and
                        subcontractors for the purpose of assessing Your
                        Project. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if You are
                        interested at any time in submitting any of the
                        foregoing Project Information for purposes of creating
                        promotional or educational material or participating in
                        research, please contact IWBI.

                        7.3. “Private” Projects. You may opt-out of the WELL
                        Project Directory for Your Project and publicity
                        opportunities by electing for Your Project to be a
                        “private project” at the time of enrollment. By electing
                        to remain “private” (a “Private Project”), Your
                        Project’s name, address and identity of the owner will
                        not appear within the WELL Project Directory. However,
                        certain other non-Project identifying information may be
                        disclosed, including, but not limited to, Project
                        location, Project size and, achievement of the Rating
                        Designation, as applicable (the “Private Project
                        Directory Information”). If Your Project is a Private
                        Project and achieves the WELL Health-Safety Rating, it
                        will automatically be transitioned to a Public Project
                        upon issuance of the Rating Designation. Nota bene: For
                        so long as Your Project maintains its election as a
                        Private Project, You may not market or represent Your
                        Project to the general public as having applied for the
                        Rating Designation if it a Private Project, and no
                        intellectual location including the Marks (defined
                        below) may be utilized or displayed in relation to Your
                        Project. You may change the privacy setting for Your
                        Project at any time before acceptance of the Rating
                        Designation using functionality in the Platform.
                        Notwithstanding the foregoing, if it is determined in
                        IWBI’s reasonable discretion that despite Your election
                        to treat Your Project as a Private Project, Your Project
                        has been/is being marketed to the public as having
                        applied for the Rating Designation, it will be deemed
                        implied consent given by You to GBCI and IWBI to
                        consider Your Project as a Public Project.

                        “Confidential Information.” Confidential Information
                        shall not include information that (a) is or becomes
                        generally available to the public (including but not
                        limited to information on any of IWBI’s public
                        directories so long as such information was not made
                        public in violation of this Agreement); (b) is lawfully

                        Party will use the same degree of care that it uses to
                        protect the confidentiality of its own proprietary
                        information of like kind (but not less than reasonable

                        protective of the Confidential Information than those

                        will return or destroy Confidential Information in the
                        receiving Party’s possession or control. Notwithstanding
                        the foregoing, the receiving Party may retain copies of

                    <strong> MODIFICATION AND WAIVER. </strong>
                    The Ancillary Documents may be updated, modified or amended
                    by IWBI at any time, with notice provided to IWBI customers

                    <strong> SEVERABILITY AND INTERPRETATION. </strong>
                    The invalidity of any part of this Agreement shall not
                    impair or affect the validity or enforceability of the rest
                    of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and
                    effect. Any provision found to be invalid shall be more
                    narrowly construed so that it becomes legal and enforceable.
                    The headings used in this document are for ease of reference
                    only and shall not in any way be construed to limit or alter
                    the meaning of any provision. Any rule that ambiguities are
                    construed or interpreted against the drafter of a document,
                    or against the party for whose benefit the document is made,
                    shall not apply. As used in this Agreement, the plural shall
                    include the singular and the singular shall include the
                    plural whenever appropriate.

                  <li>
                    <strong> ANTICORRUPTION. </strong>
                    In carrying out its respective obligations under the
                    Agreement, each Party shall comply with all applicable laws
                    and regulations of the local country and of any other
                    applicable country, including anticorruption and
                    anti-bribery laws. Each Party agrees not to pay, promise to
                    pay, or authorize the payment of any money or anything of
                    value, whether directly or indirectly, to any person
                    (whether a government official or private individual) for
                    the purpose of illegally or improperly inducing any
                    government official or any political party or official
                    thereof to make an award decision or illegally or improperly
                    to assist either Party in obtaining or retaining business,
                    or to take any other improper action favorable to either
                    Party in connection with the award of a license, permit,
                    contract or other form of award or approval.
